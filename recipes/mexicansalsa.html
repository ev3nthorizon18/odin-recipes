<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>6 medium size vine ripe tomatoes</li>
    <li>2 jalapeno peppers</li>
    <li>1 poblano peppers</li>
    <li>1 lime juice</li>
    <li>1 cup canned diced tomatoes</li>
    <li>1 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic minced</li>
    <li>1 tbsp chicken bouillon powder or sea salt</li>

</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Heat a large skillet to medium high heat. Place tomatoes and peppers in the skillet.</li>
    <li>Continue to saute, rotating the vegetables occasionally, so several sides begin to blister. See photos above. This will take around 20 minutes. Set aside to cool.</li>
    <li>Once cooled, chop off the stems of the peppers, and remove the seeds from the jalape√±o (you can also keep some seeds for more heat in your salsa). Cut the vegetables into large pieces.</li>
    <li>Place tomatoes, peppers, onions, lime, and canned tomatoes into a blender and pulse quickly until just mixed (about 5 seconds). Add garlic, cilantro, and bouillon. Pulse for another 15 seconds until well blended but chunky.</li>
    <li>Place in a large bowl and refrigerate until cooled before serving. Serve with your favorite Mexican dish or with chips.</li>
